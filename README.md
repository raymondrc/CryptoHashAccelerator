# Crypto Hash Accelerator
 In this project, several crypto hash algorigms will be implemented. These algorithms will be described with Verilog HDL, simulated by ModelSim, and implemented in Xilinx FPGA.

## TODO List
- [ ] SM3 (Chinese Hash algorithm)
- [ ] SHA-1
- [ ] SHA-256
- [ ] SHA-384
- [ ] SHA-512
- [ ] BLAKE
- [ ] HMAC-SHA1
